## Fixes

- Find out why in foreground mode system is not unmounted after exit

- Try to match standard implementation more closely (e.g. use fuse_main_real if possibly)

## Features

1. Reimplement all examples from libfuse repository in Haskell

2. Implement remaning operations in FuseOperations

3. Implement low_level bindings

4. I would like to create the following examples:

- MemoryFS.hs := In-memory file system
- VBoxFS.hs := Mount VirtualBox disks as filesystem
- SSHFS.hs := SSH file system
